## Wordle Adaptation

### _\*Word Galactica\*_

The assignment was to create my own version of Wordle. What I lack in creativity, I hopefully made up for in other ways here. Like with my code. My Wordle Adaptation is a straight up Wordle. I changed the colours to make it fun and called it something cool new and different.

## How to play

First things first, the little info button will pop up an alert explaining what the colours mean when you click it. The aim of the game is simple really, guess the randomly chosen word. \
\
Depending on what you guess, the colours will change. A greyish purple means you got the letter wrong. An almost neon pink is great, you got the letter right & in the right place. Then deep purple is the right letter, but unfortunately in the wrong place.
\
\
Simple enough really! But there is a little trick to it... If you guess a word that has the same letter more than once, and that letter is in the chosen word then it will look like it's in more than once. Think of it as my way of making Wordle harder and not because I didn't fix my code. But no, definitely was intentional.
\
\
Good luck! Have fun, refresh when you're done and keep on guessing.

## How does it actually look?

## What I'm really proud of

- My thought process from the start really helped, I wrote down a bunch of logic to breakdown how I wanted my game to run at the end
- Understanding my logic (almost) every step of the way
- Using grid correctly! Woohoo!
- Getting the keyboard to change colour with the letters
- Little things such as ending the game and getting backspace to work correctly
- Finishing it, and it actually working.. I was terrified but I felt super confident thanks to the support of everyone
- Becoming more familiar with git add & git commit

## Features I wish I had added but didn't

### (but hopefully at some point I'll come back to?)

- A restart button on the page, at the moment you have to refresh to restart play, think it might be easier to have my page fully created inside JS without any HTML (minus the keyboard)
- The option to have unlimited guesses, where you never run out of turns until you get the word correct
- Using fancy alert boxes for displaying game instructions & for when you win
- Adding animations when the colour changes, and for when you guess the word
- Computer keyboard work on input
- Changing the grid to flex so it looks better on a phone
